# Mobile-Price-Range-Classification
Classifying mobiles into different price ranges depending on various factors.

A predictive model was built from the mobile price range dataset to predict the range of a mobile phone based on different features. The model was built using different algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, decision trees, XG boost and KNN. The performance parameters of these model were closely checked in order to figure out the best model for the mobile price range prediction. KNN seemed to be the predict the price range more closely than the other algorithms for all the classes as the performance parameters for the KNN were the most consistent than other algorithms. Also, XG boost seemed to overfit the data.
