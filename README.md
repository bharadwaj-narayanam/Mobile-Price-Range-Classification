# Mobile-Price-Range-Classification
Classifying mobiles into different price ranges depending on various factors.

### Introduction
Understanding business problems plays an important role in data science. Price is the most effective attribute of marketing and business. It is the most important factor that decides the sales of that product. Mobile technology is a technology where users go, this technology also goes. The mobile phone is stimulating one of the most important technological revolutions in human history. This statement is not hyperbole. There are more mobile phones in use today than there are people. This portable technology consists of two-way communication, computing and networking technology. The number of mobile users in the world in 2019 is about 3.2 billion and increasingly in 2020 is about 3.5 billion. Different commercial activities, university courses, entertainment, communications are also done by a phone. Different organizational tasks, meetings also maintained and held virtually in this pandemic situation. As well as the use of mobile phones is increasing day by day and the prices also vary by their different attributes. Nowadays, mobile phones are selling in a huge number and within a short timespan new versions with new features are launched to market. There are many features which are important to consider a mobile price like brand, display, resolution, ram, camera, processor, chipset etc. So, it becomes very important for a company to decide on which features it should focus upon to maximize the sales of that particular mobile phone in the market. 

### Problem statement 
- The current project aims to figure out which of the attributes are the most important ones in predicting the price of the mobile phone in the market based on the data provided. - The dataset contained a list of columns or features including total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh, presence of bluetooth or not, speed at which microprocessor executes instructions,has dual sim support or not, front Camera megapixels etc. 
- The model was trained and validated using supervised ML models such as Linear regression, random forest, XG boost and KNN.

### Steps
- After the pre-processing confirming that the dataset is balanced, important visualizations were done.
- Multicollinearity was taken care of, using VIF.
- Standardized the data and then used linear regression for this classification problem.
- This was followed by various models such as KNN, Decision trees, Random forest and XGBoost.
